<hr/>
<h2> Updates </h2>
<ul>
  <li> A new driving scheme has been developed, using different methods and changing the design of the code <li>
  <li> The design has split into leaving our work to be delagated two different places. Both bots do come from the same base design so driving should be the same. </li>
  <li> The "ThreeMotor......." class is lying, there is really four motors, the names will be updated to something better prior to the competition </li>
  </ul>
